# Your Cool Amplenote Plugin

In this section you can provide some details about the [Amplenote plugin](https://www.amplenote.com/help/developing_amplenote_plugins) 
that this repo will implement.

## Build Configuration

Put your plugin readme in `PLUGIN_README.md` and configure your plugin details in `plugin.json`

## Installation

1. Clone this repo. `git clone git@github.com:alloy-org/plugin-template.git`
2. Copy its contents to a directory with the name of your plugin. `cp -r plugin-template my-cool-plugin`
3. `cd my-cool-plugin`
4. Install node and npm with your package manager of choice. `brew install node` or `apt install nodejs` 
5. Run `npm install` to install the packages (jest, fetch (for Jest)).  
6. Set up your repo as the remote origin. `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:my-org/my-cool-plugin.git`
7. Push your repo to GitHub. `git push`
8. ðŸŽ‰
Optional
9. If you are going to use any secret keys, put them in `.env.example`, then copy that to `.env` 
   and fill in whatever environment variables you need

## Testing

Run `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npm test` to run the tests.

If it complains about jsdom being absent, run `npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom` and try again.

### Testing With JetBrains IDE (using a visual debugger, like the Amplenote Founding Developers do)

If you are using a JetBrains IDE (Webstorm, Rubymine, anything that speaks Javascript), you can get an 
excellent debugging environment to run your tests.

[Read how to set up tests with this environment in JetBrains IDEs](https://public.amplenote.com/GPTbAGiRYddSCLtuTXGS1tSo).

### Run tests continuously as modifying the plugin

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npm run test -- --watch
```

## Building and Publishing

Once your plugin is ready to test within Amplenote, you can build and test it within Amplenote by following these steps:

0. Create a note for your plugin, if you haven't already. It needs to have at least a) settings table and b) code block. 
   More details on a valid plugin note are in the [Guide to Building Plugins](https://www.amplenote.com/help/guide_to_developing_amplenote_plugins)
1. [Install the Github Developers Plugin](https://www.amplenote.com/plugins/FZf22PXCKTRTB1tJwta1Nepq).
2. Compile your plugin using `npm run build` or `node esbuild.js` from the root folder for your project
3. Commit the resulting file (default location: `build/compiled.js`) to your git repo (e.g., `git add build/compiled.js && git commit -m "Compiled plugin"`)
4. Push your changes to GitHub (`git push`)
5. Choose "Github Plugin Builder: Refresh" from the note options menu in your plugin note

Alternatively, you can copy/paste the output markdown build (`plugin.md` or `plugin.min.md`) into your plugin note file using the [Markdown plugin](https://www.amplenote.com/plugins/KKfwtmMVtoxSCdsK5bNdnad8)
